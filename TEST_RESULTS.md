# Upload System Test Results

## ✅ Successful Components

1. **Environment Variables**: All properly set
   - Database URL: ✅ Connected
   - Cloudinary credentials: ✅ Set

2. **Database**: 
   - Neon PostgreSQL: ✅ Connected successfully
   - Tables: ✅ Created/exist
   - Can retrieve existing files: ✅ Working

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/test-env`: ✅ Working
   - `/api/upload` (GET): ✅ Working - retrieves files list

## ⚠️ Issue Found

**Cloudinary Upload Error**: Getting "Invalid Signature" error (HTTP 401)

### Possible Causes:
1. **API Secret might be incorrect** - Double-check from Cloudinary dashboard
2. **API Key might be incorrect** - Verify from Cloudinary dashboard
3. **Cloud name mismatch** - Ensure it matches exactly

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Option 1: Verify Credentials (Recommended)
1. Go to [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Click on "Dashboard" in the sidebar
3. In the "Account Details" section, click "Reveal" next to API Secret
4. Copy the **exact** values (no extra spaces):
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key
   - API Secret
5. Update `.env.local` with the correct values
6. Restart the server (`npm run dev`)

### Option 2: Use Browser Upload
While we fix the API credentials, you can still test via browser:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/upload-test
2. Try uploading a file through the web interface
3. Check http://localhost:3000/files to see if it appears

## 📊 Current Status

- **1 file already in system**: A Word document uploaded successfully before
- **Database working**: Can store and retrieve file metadata
- **Need to fix**: Cloudinary authentication for new uploads

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
2. Test upload via browser at `/upload-test`
3. Once working, files will appear at `/files`

---

**Note**: The system was previously working (there's already 1 file uploaded), so the setup is correct. The current issue is likely just incorrect credentials in `.env.local`.
